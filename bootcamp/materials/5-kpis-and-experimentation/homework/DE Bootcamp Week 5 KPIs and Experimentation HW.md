# LinkedIn Product Analysis and Experimentation

## **User Journey with LinkedIn**

I've been using LinkedIn for over a year now, starting when I was just entering the professional world. Initially, it was a simple online resume platform for me—a place to list my education, skills, and work experience. Over time, LinkedIn evolved into a powerful networking tool after I purchased LinkedIn Premium. I began connecting with colleagues, classmates, and industry professionals, which expanded my network and exposed me to new opportunities.

What I love most about LinkedIn today is its ability to provide valuable industry insights and foster professional growth. The platform’s tailored job recommendations have been instrumental in my career development. Additionally, the content shared by my network keeps me updated on industry trends. The "Open to Work" feature and skills endorsements from peers further enhance the platform's utility. Now, LinkedIn is not just a professional network but a daily source of inspiration and growth.

## **Experiment 1: Enhanced Networking Suggestions**

**Objective:** Improve user engagement by suggesting more personalized networking connections based on recent activity, shared interests, and mutual connections.

**Null Hypothesis:** Enhanced networking suggestions do not increase user engagement compared to the current algorithm.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Enhanced networking suggestions increase user engagement compared to the current algorithm.

**Test Cell Allocation:** 50%-50%

* **Control Group:** Users receive standard networking suggestions.  
* **Test Group:** Users receive enhanced networking suggestions based on recent activity, shared interests, and mutual connections.

**Leading Metrics:**

* Increase in the number of connection requests sent.  
* Increase in the number of profile views.

**Lagging Metrics:**

* Increase in long-term user activity (weekly active users).  
* Higher retention rates over a 6-month period.

## **Experiment 2: Interactive Learning Modules**

**Objective:** Test whether adding interactive learning modules (e.g., quizzes, interactive case studies) within LinkedIn Learning courses improves course completion rates and user satisfaction.

**Null Hypothesis:** Adding interactive learning modules does not affect course completion rates or user satisfaction.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Adding interactive learning modules increases course completion rates and user satisfaction.

**Test Cell Allocation:** 50%-50%

* **Control Group:** Users experience traditional LinkedIn Learning courses without interactive elements.  
* **Test Group:** Users experience LinkedIn Learning courses with added interactive modules.

**Leading Metrics:**

* Increase in the average time spent on LinkedIn Learning.  
* Increase in the number of courses started.

**Lagging Metrics:**

* Increase in course completion rates.  
* Higher user satisfaction scores in post-course surveys.

## **Experiment 3: Gamified Endorsements**

**Objective:** Test whether gamifying the endorsements feature (e.g., badges, progress bars) increases the number and quality of endorsements given and received.

**Null Hypothesis:** Gamifying endorsements does not impact the number or quality of endorsements.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Gamifying endorsements increases both the number and quality of endorsements.

**Test Cell Allocation:** 50%-50%

* **Control Group:** Users see the traditional endorsements feature.  
* **Test Group:** Users see a gamified endorsements feature with badges and progress bars.

**Leading Metrics:**

* Increase in the number of endorsements given per user.  
* Increase in the number of endorsements received per user.

**Lagging Metrics:**

* Improved profile visibility (more profile views).  
* Increase in user engagement (more frequent logins and interactions).
